Cactus Jack a player can win in numerous ways: If a player rolls 7 or 11 on the first roll, they WIN. The player who rolls 2, 3 or 12 that player LOSES. 
If you roll any other number it becomess your POINT. Keep rolling until you roll you point again and WIN or roll a 7 and LOSE.

The Yahtzee game is very simple and easy. Players enter their name and once the ENTER key is press, the dice rolls are automatic. There are three rounds. 
A player who rolls a dice of the same three number gets 40 POINTS. After the rounds, WINNERS and LOSERS are announced.

In Ludo, the number of players and their names are entered. The enter key is press and a dice is rolled. If a player rolls a 0 a piece is placed. 
The player who reaches the 52nd spot will WIN the game
